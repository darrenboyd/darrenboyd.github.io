    <p>
  I'm one of those lucky people who discovered early on in life that I could
  make a career doing what I love &dash; developing software. With a few
  exceptions, my work has focused on building online applications.  Below are a
  few notable highlights and accomplishments.
</p>
<h3>The Early Years</h3>
<div class='with-img left'>
  <img alt='Western Computer Link' src='/images/my-work/wcl-1997.png'>
  <p>
    I was fortunate enough to work for my first startup while in college.
    <em>Western Computer Link</em> was an Internet Service Provider during the
    mid-90s growth spurt of the Internet. I had a great relationship with WCL:
    I helped manage the systems in return for free dial-up access <img class='emoji' title=':thumbsup:' alt=':thumbsup:' src='https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png' height='20' width='20' align='absmiddle' />.
  </p>
  <p>
    WCL didn't really have a web site when I worked there.  There wasn't much
    point, since very few people had a browser on their computer.  Email was
    the killer-app of the Internet.  In fact, people could walk into our office
    and buy Netscape Navigator, which came in a cardboard box.
  </p>
  <p>
    The WCL screenshot is from the
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970429192003/http://www.link.ca/">Internet Archive</a>,
    circa 1997. I had moved on by that time, so I can't take any credit for the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will take credit for creating <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970429192633/http://www.link.ca/~dboyd/">
    this early online profile</a>, though.  Yeah, I've been a big Linux fan
    for a <strong>long</strong> time.
  </p>
</div>
<h3>The Consulting Years</h3>
<p>
  After College I moved to Calgary and over the next decade got a great mix of
  development experience. I started with <a href="http://www.valmet.com/">SCADA</a>
  software.  I then moved onto online product-focused worked, first as a consultant
  for Montage IT Services and finally as a freelance-contractor.
</p>
<p>
  In early 2007 I decided to go on an adventure. My wife and I packed up and
  moved from Calgary to Los Angeles, and began an exploration of the Golden
  State.  We're still here. Not at all surprising since California is a large,
  varied, wonderful place <img class='emoji' title=':grinning:' alt=':grinning:' src='https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png' height='20' width='20' align='absmiddle' />.
</p>
<h3>JibJab</h3>
<div class='with-img right'>
  <img alt='JibJab - Starring You' src='/images/my-work/3_easy_steps.jpg'>
  <p>
    In Los Angeles I immediately went to work on a project for
    <a href="http://www.jibjab.com/">JibJab</a>.  I built out the Rails
    backend for their initial <em>Starring You</em> product (which is
    now <a href="http://www.jibjab.com/ecards"><em>ecards</em></a>).
    It was a wonderful introduction to a culture where online software development
    was the primary focus of the company, and I knew I'd found my niche.
  </p>
</div>
<h3>Tapioca Mobile</h3>
<p>
  Following the initial product release of the JibJab project, I moved to San
  Diego to work with Tapioca Mobile.  Tapioca had just received funding and was
  scaling out their team.  The company was five people strong when I joined.
</p>
<p>
  At Tapioca, we built out a service that distributed videos to cell-phones
  using MMS.  It was an incredible experience. The technology we worked on was
  as challenging as it was varied.  Our system handled video uploads and
  management, video transcoding (for dozens of different device capabilities
  and formats), SMS and MMS aggregator integration, and a distributed workflow
  to tie it all together.
</p>
<p>
  Although the company ceased operations abruptly in 2010 for complicated and
  unfortunate reasons, it was still one of the best work experiences I have ever
  had.  There was another silver lining too, moving on from Tapioca brought me
  the Bay Area.
</p>
<h3>Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>
  Moving to the Bay Area has been incredible.  Even though technology startups
  are anywhere and everywhere today, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley exude a
  strong sense of entrepreneurialism, and host a large and active community
  that I am thrilled, every day, to be involved with.
</p>
<h4>Zendesk</h4>
<div class='with-img left'>
  <img alt='Zendesk Mentor' class='small' src='/images/my-work/Mentor_Square_720_RGB.png'>
  <p>
    I've had the pleasure of working on very interesting projects in Silicon
    Valley. One notable company is Zendesk, which recently had its very
    successful IPO. While I wasn't at Zendesk long, I was able to make some good
    friends and work with many talented engineers on several interesting
    projects. I'm happy for all my friends and colleagues there, who definitely
    are deserving of their success.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I typically prefer to join companies when they are just starting to
    scale, I joined Zendesk later in its growth. They were already at 40
    employees when I started, and expanding at a tremendous rate.  It wasn't
    long before I was looking for a much younger startup.
  </p>
</div>
<h4>Realgravity</h4>
<div class='with-img right'>
  <img alt='Realgravity Logo' class='small' src='/images/my-work/realgravity.png'>
  <p>
    My real love is to take small companies and scale them up.  Realgravity
    gave me that chance again. When I started at Realgravity the company was
    less than 10 people, split between Los Angeles and San Francisco. My work
    developing our online video services was both fun and challenging.  I was
    able to scale up the service several orders of magnitude as well as build
    out a team of talented people.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2012 Realgravity was acquired by
    <a href="http://www.scrippsnetworksinteractive.com/">Scripps Networks Interactive</a>
    and its focus changed to meet the demands of an internal SNI project (since
    released as <a href="http://www.ulive.com/">ulive</a>). This change brought
    other new experiences for me. Although SNI kept Realgravity as a separately
    run entity, I went from working for a company that had 5 people at its
    previous holiday party (including spouses!), to a company of more than
    2000 people.
  </p>
</div>
<h4>My Own Path</h4>
<div class='with-img left'>
  <p>
    I always knew that someday I wanted to strike out and build a company from
    scratch. Of course, I didn't do it on my own.  I found a great co-founder,
    who had a good idea to work on, and we started building
    <a href="https://www.blujack.com/">Blujack</a>.
  </p>
  <img alt='Blujack' class='small' src='/images/my-work/blujack.png'>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2013 I joined the ranks of the unemployed and started
    working on all aspects of Blujack.  After spending two decades working
    mainly on startups, I thought I had a good handle on what that would
    entail. How naive of me. I learn more and more, each and every day, about
    all aspects of this business.  The Blujack experience has enriched my
    knowledge, not just from a software engineering perspective, but has
    provided me with great insight into the business, financial, legal and
    personal aspects of starting and running a company.  It has made me even
    more confident that I can be a contributing member of this industry I care
    so much about.
